## A 32-bit RISCV-based Microcontroller in 180nm CMOS Technology for Low-Power IoT Applications
While India is poised to emerge as the _Hotbed for IoT Opportunities_, it's semiconductor dependencies is a glaring reminder of a long road ahead before being technologically independent. This project is a step towards the goal of bridging that gap. This microcontroller is intended for use in low-power IoT based applications such as environment (temperature, humidity, air-quality) monitoring systems. Some of the major design efforts in this project are:

- Generating a small-footprint and low-power RISC-V core  using the open-source [PULPino](https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulpino) platform developed at ETH Zurich.
- Verification of the core with applcation C-programs.
- Implementing the PULPino core on a Xilinx's Artix-7 FPGA development board to emulate the microcontroller and test the intended applications in real time.
