## A 32-bit RISC-V-based Microcontroller in 180nm CMOS Technology for Low-Power IoT Applications
While India is poised to emerge as the _Hotbed for IoT Opportunities_, it's semiconductor dependencies is a glaring reminder of a long road ahead before being technologically independent. This project is a step towards the goal of bridging that gap. This microcontroller is intended for use in low-power IoT based applications such as environment (temperature, humidity, air-quality) monitoring systems. Some of the major design efforts in this project are:

- Generating a small-footprint and low-power RISC-V core  using the open-source [PULPino](https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulpino) platform developed at ETH Zurich.
- Verification of the core with IoT application C-programs.
- Implementing the PULPino core on a Xilinx's Artix-7 FPGA development board to emulate the microcontroller and test the intended applications in real time. 
- Creating and verifying a GDS-II of the core for 180nm CMOS technology.
- A 10-bit, 100 kHz Successive Approximation Resistor (SAR) ADC for interfacing sensors to the microcontroller.
- Temperature-independent voltage and current reference for biasing internal circuits.
- Temperature compensated Ring-Oscillator for generating internal clock signal. 

## A sub-nanoamp Programmable Current Reference Design in 28nm CMOS Technology
This is an industry-collaborated project developing various analog IP blocks for an ultra-efficient neuromorphic processor in 28-nanometer CMOS technology. Various analog and mixed-signal blocks require a programmable current reference all the way down to sub-nanoamp of current which extremely challenging in this technology. Major design efforts in this project are:
- Architecture of a temperature-independent voltage and current reference circuit.
- Design of the voltage and current reference circuits using enterprise Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools.
- Layout and verification (DRC/LVS/QRC) of all the designed blocks in the 28nm CMOS technology.
