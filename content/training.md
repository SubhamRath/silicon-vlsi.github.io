# Trainings 

## A Training on Analog and Mixed-mode VLSI Design, Characterization and Layout for Industry Freshers

## A Training on SKILL Scripting for the development of Process Design Kit (PDK) in 180nm Technology

## A complete Long Term Digital VLSI Design Course and Laboratary for Under Graduate Students

## A Summer Course on Foundation of VLSI for UG, PG and Industry Freshers

The growing VLSI industry always demands people with good fundamentals as well as good engineering knowledge on VLSI domain. For this requirement this summere course "Foundation of VLSI" was started to improove their understanding as well as strengthen there VLSI fundamentals. This course covers from a very starting point of MOSFET operation to the highly complex Static Timing Analysis (STA), Logic Synthesis (LS) and Physical Design (PD). The first part of this course covers an intensive discussions on MOSFET operations, combinational circuit designs and sequential logic design and its different timing characteristics. Second part of this course gives a detail view of standard cell library and its importance in digital vlsi dsign. Additionally basic static timing analysis (STA) is introduced in this part to understand the timing constraints for both combinational and sequential cells in digital VLSI design. The third part of this course deals with the advanced static timing analysis and logic synthesis. The Final part of this course ends with a hands-on session using OpenSTA. The couse outcomes are;

- provides a very strong fundamentals on CMOS technology, MOSFET Operations, combinational and sequential designs
- provides detailes understanding of backend digital design as well as standard cell library and its use
- provides a detailed knowledge on basic and advanced static timing analysis of digital VLSI design
- patricepants gets a hands-on training facility through OpenSTA to check different timing characteristics of a complex design
