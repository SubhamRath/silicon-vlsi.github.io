## A Training on Analog and Mixed-signal VLSI Design, Characterization and Layout for Industry Freshers (Jan-Present, 2021)

Analog and Mixed signal (AMS) VLSI design is one of the rare and highly important domain in VLSI industry. AMS design is comparatively difficult and time consuming because of its design complexity, competitive specifications, technology dependency and full custom design. So the AMS VLSI domain always wants people who have solid understanding on analog devices and circuits, good amount of circuit design knowledge and experienced with circuit characterization and layot design. Due to the above requirement this "ANalog and Mixed-signal VLSI" has been started. The first part of the course focused on essential active and passive components important for analog desisgn. In second part it covers simple circutis like current mirrors, single stage amplifiers and differential amplifiers and its design methedology. In third part we are going to cover advanced and complex circuits using the simple circuits. In the final part of this course students will design more application specifice systems like BGR, LDO, Oscillator, ADC and DAC. Apart from this circuit design, more focous is giving on circuit characterization and full custom layout design. After completion of this course the participants will able to;

- understand the biasing of the circuits, snall-signal model and large signal behaviours of MOSFETS, frequency response of the circuits
- design and caracterize simple circuits, also able to design layout of different circuits considering layout rules, recomendations and guidelines
- design current mirrors, error amplifiers, comparators, sample-and-hold circuits etc
- floorplan, placement and routing of highly complex blocks like, bandgap reference (BGR), digital-to-analog converter (DAC), Temperatiue sensor circuits, Oscillatotors etc

## A complete Long Term Digital VLSI Design Course and Laboratary for Under Graduate Students (Jul-Dec, 2020)

From the VLSI industry point of view major part of the the VLSI work (more than 80%) is under digital VLSI design. From RTL degin to GDS formation several micro divisions are there to complete the flow. To work in any micro-division a basic understanding of digital VLSI design is very important. This course is specifically designed for UG students to understand, design and characterize cominational and sequential circuits, dynamic logic circuits and different type of memory circuits. Module-1 covers on MOS Structure and MOSFET operations in more details. Module-2 covers the static and dymnamic characteristics of an Inverter design, which is most important because the the principle uses in the simple inverter can be applicable on any type of circuit. Module-3 covers the design and characterization of both combinational circuits and sequential circuits. Module-4 of this course deals with the dynamic circuits (DOMINO, NORA, ZIPPER, TSPC) design and memory design (SRAM, DRAM). To check theoritical concept of cominational and sequential designs few laboratary eperiments also included in this course. The major outcomes of this course are;

- fully understanding of MOSFET and its operations for digital logic design
- Fully undestanding of static (VTC, Noise Margin) and dynamic characteristics (Delay, power) which will help to design and characterice any type of digital logic
- Design and timing characterization (setup time, hold time, recover time, removal time) of sequential circuiys (Latch, D-FF)
- understanding and design of high performance dynamic logic circuits (DOMINO, NORA, ZIPPER, TSPC etc)
- Understanding and design of static random access memory (SRAM) circuits

## A Summer Course on Foundation of VLSI for UG, PG and Industry Freshers (Feb-Jul, 2020)

The growing VLSI industry always demands people with good fundamentals as well as good engineering knowledge on VLSI domain. For this requirement this summere course "Foundation of VLSI" was started to improove their understanding as well as strengthen there VLSI fundamentals. This course covers from a very starting point of MOSFET operation to the highly complex Static Timing Analysis (STA), Logic Synthesis (LS) and Physical Design (PD). The first part of this course covers an intensive discussions on MOSFET operations, combinational circuit designs and sequential logic design and its different timing characteristics. Second part of this course gives a detail view of standard cell library and its importance in digital vlsi dsign. Additionally basic static timing analysis (STA) is introduced in this part to understand the timing constraints for both combinational and sequential cells in digital VLSI design. The third part of this course deals with the advanced static timing analysis and logic synthesis. The Final part of this course ends with a hands-on session using OpenSTA. The couse outcomes are;

- provides a very strong fundamentals on CMOS technology, MOSFET Operations, combinational and sequential designs
- provides detailes understanding of backend digital design as well as standard cell library and its use
- provides a detailed knowledge on basic and advanced static timing analysis of digital VLSI design
- patricepants gets a hands-on training facility through OpenSTA to check different timing characteristics of a complex design
