## Analog and Mixed-signal VLSI Design, Characterization and Layout (4 January - Present, 2021)

Analog and mixed signal (AMS) VLSI design is one of the rare and highly important domains in VLSI industry. AMS design is comparatively difficult and time consuming because of its design complexity, competitive specifications, technology dependency and full custom design. So the AMS VLSI domain always wants people who have solid understanding on analog devices and circuits, good amount of circuit design knowledge and experienced with circuit characterization and layout design. Due to the above requirement this "Analog and Mixed-signal VLSI" has been started. All the laboratory and projects will be done in commercial EDA tools (Cadence). 0.18um HV SOI process technology is used to design and layout purpose for this course. The first part of the course focused on essential active and passive components important for analog design. In second part it covers simple circuits like current mirrors, single stage amplifiers and differential amplifiers and its design methodology. In third part we are going to cover advanced and complex circuits using the simple circuits. In the final part of this course students will design more application specific systems like BGR, LDO, Oscillator, ADC and DAC. Apart from this circuit design, more focus is giving on circuit characterization and full custom layout design. After completion of this course the participants will able to;

- understand the biasing of the circuits, small-signal model and large signal behaviors of MOSFETS, frequency response of the circuits
- design and characterize simple circuits, also able to design layout of different circuits considering layout rules, recommendations and guidelines
- design current mirrors, error amplifiers, comparators, sample-and-hold circuits etc
- floor plan, placement and routing of highly complex blocks like, band gap reference (BGR), digital-to-analog converter (DAC), Temperature sensor circuits, Oscillators etc 
- This course was started from 4th January, 2021

## Pcell development using SKILL Scripting

Scripting is a necessity for CAD engineers but can also enable circuit designers to do complex activities efficiently. SKILL programming language is based on artificial intelligence language Lisp. SKILL lets designers quickly and easily customizes existing CAD applications and helps them to develop new applications. SKILL scripting language can be used to develop Pcells. A parameterized cell, or PCell, is a programmable cell that lets designers create a customized instance each time they place it. This course was aim to develop Pcells using SKILL scripting in 0.18um CMOS technology. From this training the participants able to;

- create Pcells using SKILL scripting
- add labels to pins in a layout
- generate layout from schematic view from all cells in a library
- create rectangular and polygon shape with certain Width and Length
- create CDF information for the Pcell
- This course was conducted from 12th October to 19th December, 2020


## A Long Term Digital VLSI Design Course and Laboratory for Under Graduate Students 

From the VLSI industry point of view major part of the VLSI work (more than 80%) is under digital VLSI design. From RTL deign to GDS formation several micro divisions are there to complete the flow. To work in any micro-division a basic understanding of digital VLSI design is very important. This course is specifically designed for UG students to understand, design and characterize combinational and sequential circuits, dynamic logic circuits and different type of memory circuits. Module-1 covers on MOS Structure and MOSFET operations in more details. Module-2 covers the static and dynamic characteristics of an Inverter design, which is most important because the principle uses in the simple inverter can be applicable on any type of circuit. Module-3 covers the design and characterization of both combinational circuits and sequential circuits. Module-4 of this course deals with the dynamic circuits (DOMINO, NORA, ZIPPER, TSPC) design and memory design (SRAM, DRAM). To check theoretical concept of combinational and sequential designs few laboratory experiments also included in this course. The major outcomes of this course are;

- fully understanding of MOSFET and its operations for digital logic design
- Fully understanding of static (VTC, Noise Margin) and dynamic characteristics (Delay, power) which will help to design and characterize any type of digital logic
